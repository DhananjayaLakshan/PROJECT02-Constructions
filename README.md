<h1>Construction Mnagement System</h1>

<p><b>This part for create appointmnts</b></p>

<p>This project is created by using react, tailwind CSS and flowbite-react for frontend. Node.js and Express.js for back-end. For notifications I use SweetAlert02 and Toast messages.</p>
<p>
  This system has login and registration forms and the user will authenticate by using JsonWebToken. For the front-end use Redux for state management.
  Normal user can make appointments and they can see them in their profile. It will confirmed by the admin and the user can download their appointment confirmation as a PDF.
  Admin can create, edit, and remove clients. Admin can remove and confirm the appointments. The system displays the total count of Clients and Appointments.
